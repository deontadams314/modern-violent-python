# ⚔️ Modern Violent Python — Rewritten & Modernized

This repo contains re-creations of scripts from the book, Violent Python. The goal is to created  updated versions of some of the scripts with  current libraries, standards, and workflows. I want to  focus on maintaining modularity, readability, and real offensive security utility.

This project takes inspiration from the book's examples, but retools them using:

- Python 3.13+
- Virtual environments & `requirements.txt`
- `passlib`, `argparse`, `concurrent.futures`, etc.
- Cleaner code, safer practices, and extensible design
